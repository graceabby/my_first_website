		<h1>Developing a Website</h1>
		<p>The first step to creating a website is to create folder. Once a folder has been created, create 3 folders inside of it. These folders are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>css</li>
			<li>js</li>
			<li>images</li>
		</ul>
		<p>After the folders have been created open <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/" target="_blank">Sublime Text</a>. Once Sublime has opened:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Drag the folder onto to the Sublime icon</li>
			<li>Create a new file - File -> New</li>
			<li>Save the file in the root of the website folder as index.html</li>
		</ol>
